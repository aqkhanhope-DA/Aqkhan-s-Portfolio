# [Project:1 Crowdfunding Kickstarter Project Analysis]()

## Business Problem & Objective
### Business Problem:
Crowdfunding platforms generate large amounts of raw data (Epoch timestamps, currencies) that make trend analysis difficult.

### Objective:
To clean, model, and visualize crowdfunding data for insights into project success, funding amounts, and backer engagement.

# Data Sources
- **Projects.xlsx** – Details of all crowdfunding projects (goal, amount raised, dates).
- **Category.xlsx** – Project categories for analysis.
- **Location.xlsx** – Geographic location data for projects.
- **Creator.xlsx** – Information about project creators.
- **Projects.sql**- SQL file containing project database setup or queries

- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation
- **Power BI** – Dashboard building and reporting
- **Tableau** – Data visualization and analysis
- **SQL** – Data querying and joins

# Data Preparation Steps
1. Convert Epoch time → Natural date
2. Build Calendar table with fiscal metrics
3. Create data model linking all files
4. Convert Goal to USD using static rate
5. Build KPIs in Power BI/Tableau
