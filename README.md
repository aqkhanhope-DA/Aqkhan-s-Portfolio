# [Project:2 Crowdfunding Project Analysis]()

## Business Problem & Objective
### Business Problem:
Crowdfunding platforms generate large amounts of raw data (Epoch timestamps, currencies) that make trend analysis difficult.

### Objective:
To clean, model, and visualize crowdfunding data for insights into project success, funding amounts, and backer engagement.

# Data Sources
Projects.xlsx ‚Äì Details of all crowdfunding projects (goal, amount raised, dates).
Category.xlsx ‚Äì Project categories for analysis.
Location.xlsx ‚Äì Geographic location data for projects.
Creator.xlsx ‚Äì Information about project creators.
Projects.sql- SQL file containing project database setup or queries

Excel ‚Äì Data cleaning and preparation
Power BI ‚Äì Dashboard building and reporting
Tableau ‚Äì Data visualization and analysis
SQL ‚Äì Data querying and joins

# Data Preparation Steps
1. Convert Epoch time ‚Üí Natural date
2. Build Calendar table with fiscal metrics
3. Create data model linking all files
4. Convert Goal to USD using static rate
5. Build KPIs in Power BI/Tableau
